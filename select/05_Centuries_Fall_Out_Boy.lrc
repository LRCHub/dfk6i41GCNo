[00:12.76] 
[00:05.74] Some legends are told
[00:07.89] Some turn to dust or to gold
[00:10.59] But you will remember me
[00:14.13] Remember me, for centuries
[00:27.13] 
[00:17.00] And just one mistake
[00:19.36] Is all it will take
[00:21.49] We'll go down in history
[00:25.07] Remember me for centuries
[00:28.09] Hey-ya, a-hey, hey-ya
[00:35.84] Remember me for centuries
[00:48.34] 
[00:39.11] Mummified my teenage dreams
[00:41.81] No, it's nothing wrong with me
[00:44.29] The kids are all wrong, the story's all off
[00:47.01] Heavy metal broke my heart
[01:00.01] 
[00:49.92] Come on, come on, and let me in
[00:52.30] Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
[00:55.23] And this is for to match
[00:56.45] The darkness that you felt
[00:57.80] I never meant for you to fix yourself
[01:16.30]

[01:28.15] Hey-ya, a-hey, hey-ya
[01:38.65] 
[01:35.74] Remember me for centuries
[01:48.24] 
[01:38.34] And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
[01:41.54] 'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
[01:44.24] Until you die for me, as long as there's a light
[01:47.08] My shadow's over you
[01:48.24] 'Cause I-I am the opposite of amnesia
[01:54.81] And you're a cherry blossom
[01:56.67] You're about to bloom
[01:58.02] You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
[02:19.52]

[02:35.90] Remember me for centuries
[02:48.40] 
[02:39.16] We've been here forever
[02:44.23] And here's the frozen proof
[02:49.86] I could scream forever
[02:55.12] We are the poisoned youth
